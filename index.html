A future without costly intermediation. A future where you can interact with other players of the global financial system in a fair and transparent way regardless of your geographic or socioeconomic background. A future where no single institution or group of institutions has control over the assets we all share.

                                                            Dr. Gavin Wood is the Co-Founder of Parity Technologies and President of Web3 Foundation. Gavin is developing the next generation of blockchain tech with Polkadot, the interoperability platform of public/private app-specific blockchains to power a decentralized web 3.0 that will disrupt centralized internet powers and provide a platform for developers to create more equitable, peer-to-peer societal institutions that are not possible today. To help foster blockchain innovation, Gavin recently released blockchain-building tech Substrate.

                                                              After decade working in renewable energy focused on the negotiation, development, execution and operation of utility-scale renewable generation assets, I discovered Bitcoin in late 2012 and subsequently became very passionate about the Ethereum ecosystem and blockchain technology generally. I began as an Angel Investor supporting start-ups developing deeply compelling innovations with blockchain-enabled networks. Today, my focus is on finding great projects and technical teams that could realize significant network effects with the right tokenization strategy for the Polychain Capital fund as well as finding great investment partners to help Polychain Capital continue its outlier growth.

                                                  After graduating from Cambridge with a degree in Natural Sciences in 1986, Rus traded commodities for Shell, Salomon Brothers & JP Morgan before co-founding Global Advisors with Danny Masters in 1999. After 15 years running commodity strategies, in 2013 Global pivoted into digital assets, launching the world's first regulated bitcoin fund - GABI. Through its asset management business -- CoinShares -- the group manages more than $500M in digital assets including Nasdaq-listed ETNs tracking bitcoin & ethereum and has invested in many ICOs and blockchain-related startups. Rus focuses on investment research & financial engineering.
